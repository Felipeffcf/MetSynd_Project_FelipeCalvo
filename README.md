# Metabolic Syndrome Analysis – Python Data Science Project
This repository contains my data science project for the Python for Data Science course at Université Paris Dauphine. The goal is to analyse the determinants and patterns of Metabolic Syndrome using statistical exploration, visualization, and predictive modelling.

  Contents:
PY_FelipeCalvo_MetSyn - Notebook (.ipynb), complete analysis workflow
Report_FelipeCalvo_MetSyn – final structured written report
metabolic_syndrome.txt - dataset

  Main steps of the project:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory analysis of biological, demographic and socioeconomic factors
Visualization of distributions (KDE, boxplots, barplots…)
Numerical and categorical association tests (Pearson, Cramér’s V)
Random Forest model for predicting Metabolic Syndrome
Discussion of model choice, performance and limitations

  Tools and Libraries:
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
scikit-learn for machine learning
